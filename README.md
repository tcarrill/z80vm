# z80vm
A virtual machine based on a reduced set of the z80 ISA.</br>
<br/>
The following registers, along with their instructions, will be implemented.<br/>
`A`, `F`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `H`, and `L` as well as their 16-bit pairs `BC`, `DE`, and `HL`<br/>
</br>
The following special purpose registers will also be implemented.</br>
`SP`, `PC`, `IX`, `IY`, and `R` 

## Example
Compile the source using the provided makefile or by typing the following:

```
$ gcc -o z80 main.c z80.c
```

You can assemble the provided .asm files into object code which can then be run on the VM.
For example, using pasmo on Linux:

```
$ pasmo --bin -v add.asm add.bin
```

The above will produce an add.bin binary.  Running this file through hexdump will show us the machine code our VM reads and executes:

```
$ hexdump -C add.bin
00000000  3e 05 06 07 80 76                                 |>....v|
00000006 
```

Run this binary through the VM like so:

```
$ ./z80 add.bin
Address  Opcode
00000    3e
00002    06
00004    80
00005    76

Registers:
A    BC    DE    HL    IX    IY    SP
0c  0700  0000  0000  0000  0000  0000
```

## Idiosyncrasies
Currently, due to the lack of interrupts, the `HALT` (0x76) instruction does not operate as documented by the Z80.  We use it as a way to halt execution and end the VM process.

## Tests
Some rudimentary unit test functionality is included, compile the tests as follows:

```
$ make test
```
Or
```
$ gcc -o test test.c z80.c
```
